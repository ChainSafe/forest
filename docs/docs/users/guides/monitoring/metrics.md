title: Metrics
---

Prometheus metrics are exposed on localhost's port `6116` by default, under `/metrics`. They are enabled by default and can be disabled with the `--no-metrics` flag. The metrics endpoint can be modified with the `--metrics-address` flag.

```console
‚ùØ curl localhost:6116/metrics
# HELP lru_cache_miss Stats of lru cache miss.
# TYPE lru_cache_miss counter
lru_cache_miss_total{kind="tipset"} 7199
lru_cache_miss_total{kind="sm_tipset"} 181
# HELP lru_cache_hit Stats of lru cache hit.
# TYPE lru_cache_hit counter
lru_cache_hit_total{kind="sm_tipset"} 913
lru_cache_hit_total{kind="tipset"} 971846
...
```

The metrics include:

- networking metrics (e.g., number of peers, number of blocks received),
- database metrics (e.g., database size),
- RPC metrics (e.g., number of requests, response times),
- internal metrics (e.g., cache sizes, number of tasks).

Those can be used to monitor the node's health and create alerts. A sample Grafana dashboard is available in the [monitoring](https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest/tree/main/monitoring) directory in the Forest repository. It includes the entire Docker Compose setup to run monitoring locally. See the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest/blob/main/monitoring/README.md) file. Note that [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) is not enabled by default. To allow it, pass `--loki` to the Forest daemon.

:::tip
Because of the high cardinality of some of the metrics, a high retention period, together with high sampling rates, can lead to a large amount of data being stored. Make sure to adjust the retention period and sampling rates to your needs.
