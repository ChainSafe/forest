# Running Forest with Lotus Gateway

## Introduction

Directly exposing a Filecoin node's RPC interface is unsafe for production use. Some reasons include:

Certain methods are very expensive and can potentially be abused. The current JWT protection mechanism has only mutability checks.

- Certain methods should not be exposed to the public at all, such as `Filecoin.ChainExport`.
- There is no rate-limiting mechanism in place. This can lead to a denial-of-service attack and crashing the node.

Therefore, running a Filecoin node behind a proxy is recommended.

## Lotus Gateway

[Lotus Gateway](https://lotus.filecoin.io/lotus/configure/gateway/) is a proxy between the Filecoin node and the client. It is designed to run with the Lotus node but can also be used with Forest. It limits the exposed RPC methods and provides rate-limiting mechanisms.

:::note
For more information on configuring Lotus Gateway, refer to [Lotus Gateway documentation](https://lotus.filecoin.io/lotus/configure/gateway/). This guide assumes that your system already has a Lotus Gateway binary.

### Configuring Lotus Gateway

There is not much configuration needed to run Lotus Gateway with Forest.

1. You must export the `FULLNODE_API_INFO` environment variable with the Forest node admin JWT token and its multiaddress. You can find the Forest JWT token in its initialization logs and under the chosen file if you have set the `--save-token <path>` flag. The multiaddress is the same as the one you would use to connect to the Forest node.
2. Choose a port for the Lotus Gateway to listen on. The default is `2346`, but you can choose any port not already in use. If necessary, open the port in your firewall.
3. Ensure the Forest node is running and accessible from the Lotus Gateway.

```bash
export FULLNODE_API_INFO="<TOKEN>:/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/2345/http"
lotus-gateway run --listen 0.0.0.0:5432
```

That's it! Forest should now be available only through the Lotus Gateway. You can test it by running a sample command:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5432/rpc/v1 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"method":"Filecoin.ChainHead","params":[], "id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'
```

## 🌲Forest + 🪷 Lotus Gateway + 🐳 Docker Compose = ❤️

If you want to run Forest and Lotus Gateway in a Docker container, you can use Docker Compose. Ensure you have [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed. This will:

- create a network for the containers to communicate with each other and expose the Lotus Gateway on the configured port,
- download the snapshot and parameter files if they are not already present,
- run the Forest node and Lotus Gateway in separate containers,
- perform required initialization steps,
- restart the containers if they crash or the host machine is restarted.

Forest will be available only in the internal network, and the Lotus Gateway will be available on the host machine, which you can safely expose to the public. This is illustrated in the diagram below:

  end

```

First run might be slower due to the need to download the snapshot. Consecutive runs will be faster.

```bash
docker compose up --detach
```

`.env` file:

```
FOREST_IMAGE=ghcr.io/chainsafe/forest:v0.25.3-fat
LOTUS_IMAGE=filecoin/lotus-all-in-one:v1.32.2-calibnet
FIL_PROOFS_PARAMETER_CACHE=/var/tmp/filecoin-proof-parameters
FOREST_RPC_PORT=2345
FOREST_HEALTHZ_RPC_PORT=2346
FOREST_GATEWAY_PORT=5432
FOREST_KEYSTORE_PHRASE="<CHANGE ME>"
CHAIN=calibnet
```

Modify it as needed.
