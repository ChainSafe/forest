# JSON-RPC Overview

:::warning

This API is still a WIP, with more methods being added continuously.

## Overview

The RPC interface is the primary mechanism for interacting with Forest.

As there is presently no cross-client specification, the Lotus
[V0](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/documentation/en/api-v0-methods.md)
and
[V1](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/documentation/en/api-v1-unstable-methods.md)
APIs are the reference for Forest's implementation.

:::info

An FIP to establish a canonical RPC API specification for general use [has been proposed](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/pull/1027).

## Connecting To A Node

By default, Forest exposes the RPC API on `localhost:2345`. See [CLI docs](./cli.md) for configuration options.

### Authentication

Access control is implemented for certain methods. Levels of access include:

- Read
- Write
- Admin

Authentication is performed via [JWT Tokens](../knowledge_base/jwt_handling.md). When starting Forest use `--save-token 
<FILE>` to store an `Admin` token,
otherwise the token will be printed in the logs during startup. With this token you can call the methods `AuthNew`
to generate additional tokens as needed.
