# Forest Documentation

This directory contains a Docusaurus documentation website for both user and developer documentation.

## Getting Started

> Note: This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

### Installation

Install the required dependencies:

```
$ pnpm i
```

### Local Development

Start local development server:

```
$ pnpm start
```

### Build

To compile an optimized production build:

```
$ pnpm build
```

### CI Checks

These commands are recommended to run before committing code. They are run as checks in CI.

```
pnpm spellcheck # Checks spelling
pnpm format     # Run prettier to fix formatting issues
pnpm typecheck  # Validate typescript files
```

> **How to Fix Spellcheck Errors:** You can add unknown words to `dictionary.txt`.

### Deployment

The documentation site is continuously deployed to CloudFlare Pages, triggered on every commit to `main`. [This workflow](/.github/workflows/docs-deploy.yml) defines the deployment process.

## Site Structure

The site it comprised of two sub-sites - user documentation (`/`) and developer documentation (`/developers`). There is intentionally no link from the user docs to the developer docs, to avoid overwhelming users with unnecessary info.

### User Docs

Available at the root (`/`), default location for anyone visiting the documentation domain. Source files are under `docs/user`

Follows the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework for structuring documentation. The site is divided into four types of documentation: tutorials (Getting Started), how-to guides (Guides), explanations (Knowledge Base) and reference (Reference).

#### CLI Docs

These docs are automatically generated from the Forest CLI. See [script](/docs/docs/users/reference/cli.sh).

#### JSON-RPC Docs

We maintain comprehensive RPC documentation generated from the OpenRPC specification:

1. **Method Reference** - An interactive, searchable reference for all 246 RPC methods. Generated automatically from `docs/users/openrpc.json` by a build script. See [RPC_REFERENCE.md](./RPC_REFERENCE.md) for details.

2. **OpenRPC Schema Explorer** - An external playground linked from the docs for exploring the full schema interactively.

To regenerate the method reference after updating `openrpc.json`:

```bash
pnpm generate:rpc-reference
```

### Developer Docs

Available at `/developers`, source code is located in `docs/developers`. Comprised of a collection of documents aimed at contributors. May be relevant to power users.

> Note: As a general rule of thumb, if it involves reading or writing Rust, it should live under the Developer documentation.
