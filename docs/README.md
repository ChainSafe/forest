# Forest Documentation

This directory contains a Docusaurus documentation website for both user and developer documentation.

## Getting Started

> Note: This project uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

### Installation

Install the required dependencies:

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

Start local development server:

```
$ yarn start
```

### Build

To compile an optimized production build:

```
$ yarn build
```

### CI Checks

These commands are recommended to run before commiting code. They are run as checks in CI.

```
yarn spellcheck # Checks spelling
yarn format     # Run prettier to fix formatting issues
yarn typecheck  # Validate typescript files
```

> **How to Fix Spellcheck Errors:** You can add unknown words to `dictionary.txt`.

### Deployment

The documentation site is continuously deployed to CloudFlare Pages, triggered on every commit to `main`. [This workflow](/.github/workflows/docs-deploy.yml) defines the deployment process.

## Site Structure

The site it comprised of two sub-sites - user documentation (`/`) and developer documentation (`/developers`). There is intentionally no link from the user docs to the developer docs, to avoid overwhelming users with unnecessary info.

### User Docs

Available at the root (`/`), default location for anyone visiting the documentation domain. Source files are under `docs/user`

Follows the [DiÃ¡taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework for structuring documentation. The site is divided into four types of documentation: tutorials (Getting Started), how-to guides (Guides), explanations (Knowledge Base) and reference (Reference).

#### CLI Docs

These docs are automatically generated from the Forest CLI. See [script](/docs/docs/users/reference/cli.sh).

#### JSON-RPC Docs

We use the OpenRPC document from Forest to populate the documentation for each method. For this we use `@metamask/docusaurus-openrpc`.

### Developer Docs

Available at `/developers`, source code is located in `docs/developers`. Comprised of a collection of documents aimed at contributors. May be relevant to power users.

> Note: As a general rule of thumb, if it involes reading or writing Rust, it should live under the Developer documentation.
