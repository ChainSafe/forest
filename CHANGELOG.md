## A short guide to adding a changelog entry

- pick a section to which your change belongs in _Forest unreleased_,
- the entry should follow the format:

  `[#ISSUE_NO](link to the issue): <short description>`, for example:

  [#1234](https://github.com/chainsafe/forest/pull/1234): Add support for NV18

- if the change does not have an issue, use the PR number instead - the PR must
  have a detailed description of the change and its motivation. Consider
  creating a separate issue if the change is complex enough to warrant it,
- the changelog is not a place for the full description of the change, it should
  be a short summary of the change,
- if the change does not directly affect the user, it should not be included in
  the changelog - for example, refactoring of the codebase,
- review the entry to make sure it is correct and understandable and that it
  does not contain any typos,
- the entries should not contradict each other - if you add a new entry, ensure
  it is consistent with the existing entries.

- [#5345](https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest/pull/5345) Fixed handling of odd-length hex strings in some Eth RPC methods. Now, the methods should not return error if provided with, e.g., `0x0` (which would be expanded to `0x00`).

### Breaking

- [#4620](https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest/pull/4620) Removed the
  `--consume-snapshot` parameter from the `forest` binary. To consume a
  snapshot, use `--import-snapshot <path> --import-mode=move`.

- [#3403](https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest/issues/3403) The snapshot
  validation command `forest-tool snapshot validate` now checks the snapshots
  individually. The previous behavior, to validate the sum of the snapshots, can
  be achieved via `forest-tool snapshot validate-diffs`.

- [#4672](https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest/issues/4672) The default user in
  Docker images is now `root`. This facilitates usage, especially when mounting
  volumes and dealing with surprising permission errors. Note that the default
  data directory is now `/root/.local/share/forest` and not
  `/home/forest/.local/share/forest`. The directory will **not** be migrated
  automatically. Please adapt your configurations accordingly. If you've been
  switching to `root` manually in your workflows you can now remove that step.

  option of `--import-mode` to `auto` which hardlink snapshots and fallback to
  copying them if not applicable.

  to V1 when applicabile

  finality-related params in the `Filecoin.EthGetBlockByNumber` RPC method.

- [#4620](https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest/pull/4620) Added an option to link
  snapshots instead of moving or copying them. This can be invoked with
  `--import-snapshot <path> --import-mode=symlink`.

- [#4533](https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest/pull/4641) Added `build_info`
  metric to Prometheus metrics, which include the current build's version.

  `Filecoin.MarketAddBalance` RPC method.

- [#4701](https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest/issues/4701) Add method
  `Filecoin.EthGetTransactionByBlockHashAndIndex` to existing methods (though
  without support, which matches the current Lotus's behavior).

- [#4702](https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest/issues/4702) Add method
  `Filecoin.EthGetTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex` to existing methods (though
  without support, which matches the current Lotus's behavior).

- [#4757](https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest/pull/4757) Added an option to

## Forest v0.1.0 _alpha_ (2021-10-19)

ChainSafe System's first _alpha_ release of the _Forest_ Filecoin Rust protocol
implementation.

- It synchronizes and verifies the latest Filecoin main network and is able to
  query the latest state.
- It implements all core systems of the Filecoin protocol specification exposed
  through a command-line interface.
- The set of functionalities for this first alpha-release include: Message Pool,
  State Manager, Chain and Wallet CLI functionality, Prometheus Metrics, and a
  JSON-RPC Server.

To compile release binaries, checkout the `v0.1.0` tag and build with the
`release` feature.

```shell
git checkout v0.1.0
cargo build --release --bin forest --features release
./target/release/forest --help
```

The Forest mono-repository contains ten main components (in logical order):

- `forest`: the command-line interface and daemon (1 crate/workspace)
- `node`: the networking stack and storage (7 crates)
- `blockchain`: the chain structure and synchronization (6 crates)
- `vm`: state transition and actors, messages, addresses (9 crates)
- `key_management`: Filecoin account management (1 crate)
- `crypto`: cryptographic functions, signatures, and verification (1 crate)
- `encoding`: serialization library for encoding and decoding (1 crate)
- `ipld`: the IPLD model for content-addressable data (9 crates)
- `types`: the forest types (2 crates)
- `utils`: the forest toolbox (12 crates)
