# This Dockerfile is for building official Forest docker multiplatform images on CI,
# linux/amd64 and linux/arm64 are currently supported.
#
# This Dockerfile composes Forest binaries that are prebuilt in other CI steps, to take
# better advantage of build cache and reduce build time and cost.
#
# Build and manually push to Github Container Registry (see https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry)
# ```
# docker build -t ghcr.io/chainsafe/forest:latest .
# docker push ghcr.io/chainsafe/forest:latest
# ```

# Prod image for forest binary
# Use github action runner cached images to avoid being rate limited
