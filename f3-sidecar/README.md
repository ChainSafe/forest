### Dependencies

In addition to the Rust toolchain, Go toolchain is required to build the
`f3-sidecar`. The Go version is specified in `go.mod`.

Follow https://go.dev/doc/install or use one of the version managers of Go.
(e.g. https://github.com/voidint/g?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

### EC tests

- run a forest node locally and expose RPC port at the default 2345
- run `go test -v .`

### Run sidecar

- run a forest node on calibnet (make sure to save jwt token with
  `--save-token jwt_path`)
- import a shared miner key for testing `forest-wallet --remote-wallet import`
  (the shared miner worker key can be found in `scripts/tests/api_compare/.env`)
- run f3 sidecar `go run . -jwt $(cat jwt_path)`
- (optional) to inspect RPC calls, run
  `mitmproxy --mode reverse:http://localhost:2345 --listen-port 8080` then
  `go run . -rpc http://127.0.0.1:8080/rpc/v1`

### How F3 sidecar interacts with Forest

An F3 sidecar node is a standalone node that is a part of a p2p network and
participates in the f3 protocol.

Besides what have been handled internally(e.g. p2p communications) in the
`go-f3` lib

- it uses `level-db` as a storage backend
- it's bootstrapped with a manifest that contains parameters like bootstrapping
  epoch, chain finality and network name etc. the manifest can be constructed
  either statically, or dynamically by connecting to a p2p manifest server
- it requires an EC(expected consensus) backend to obtain the chain information
  like chain head and power table etc.
- it requires a signer backend to sign messages with the private keys of the
  participating miners
- it requires a backend that provides the actor IDs of the participating miners
- it requires a p2p node as bootstrapper to discover more peers via Kademlia
- additionally, to power the `Filecoin.F3*` RPC methods in forest, a sidecar
  node runs an RPC server that implements the same RPC methods to which the
  associated forest node can delegate the RPC requests

### To build and run F3 sidecar within Forest via FFI

By default, the Go F3-sidecar is built and linked into Forest binary unless
environment variable `FOREST_F3_SIDECAR_FFI_BUILD_OPT_OUT=1` is set.

F3 sidecar is not started by default, set `FOREST_F3_SIDECAR_FFI_ENABLED=1` to
opt in.

Set dynamic manifest server via `FOREST_F3_MANIFEST_SERVER`, e.g.
`FOREST_F3_MANIFEST_SERVER=12D3KooWENMwUF9YxvQxar7uBWJtZkA6amvK4xWmKXfSiHUo2Qq7`
