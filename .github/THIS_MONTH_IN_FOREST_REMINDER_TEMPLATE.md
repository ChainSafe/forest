Each month, we put together a summary of the latest Forest updates for our community. Use this reminder and checklist to get ready for the next _This Month in Forest_ post. Ensure that you include it in the final sprint of the month.

## Checklist for This Month in Forest

When preparing the summary, keep these points in mind:

- Review the past month's pull requests and issues on the Forest GitHub repository. Is there anything notable to highlight?
- Check the Forest Slack channels for any significant discussions or announcements.
- Is there any event upcoming or recently held that should be mentioned?
- Are there mandatory updates or changes that users should be aware of?
- Are there new contributors or community members to recognize?

After gathering the information:

- [ ] Organize the collected information into a coherent summary.
- [ ] Gather any relevant statistics or metrics that showcase the project's progress.
- [ ] Draft the summary and share it with the team for feedback.
- [ ] Publish it to the [Forest announcements on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest/discussions)
- [ ] Pin it in the discussions tab for visibility.
- [ ] Re-publish on other channels, e.g., `#fil-forest-announcements` on Slack.
- [ ] Let the content team know for further dissemination.
