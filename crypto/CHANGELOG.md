# 0.5.2

- `pairing` feature doesn't use Rayon anymore so it can compile to wasm

# 0.5.1

- Changed `blst` to a default feature, and added `pairing` flag to use pairings
  instead.

# 0.5.0

- Removed `from_byte` for `DomainSeparationTag`. If this is needed, can use the
  `FromPrimitive` trait.
- Removes `Default` for `Signature`. This was an old need for when block
  signatures were not optional in `BlockHeader`s.
