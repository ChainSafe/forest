# Consensus Types

This folder contains consensus types we can use with [Hierarchical Consensus]:
* [Filecoin Consensus](../fil_consensus) is the default consensus for the root net. _TODO: Move the crate here._
* [Delegated Consensus](./deleg_cns/) is a simplistic consensus for testing subnets, where only one miner can propose blocks in the network.
