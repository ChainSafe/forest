# Consensus Types

This folder contains consensus types we can use with [Hierarchical Consensus]:
* [Filecoin Consensus](./fil_cns) is the default consensus for the root net.
* [Delegated Consensus](./deleg_cns) is a simplistic consensus for testing networks, where only one miner can propose blocks in the network.
