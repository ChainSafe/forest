//! Archives are key-value pairs encoded as
//! [CAR files](https://ipld.io/specs/transport/car/carv1/). The key-value pairs
//! represent a directed, acyclic graph (DAG). This graph is often a subset of a larger
//! graph and references to missing keys are common.
//!
//! Each graph contains blocks, messages, state trees, and miscellaneous data
//! such as compiled `WASM` code. The amount of data differs greatly in different
//! kinds of archives. While there are no fixed definitions, there are three
//! common kind of archives:
//! - A full archive contains a complete graph with no missing nodes. These
//!   archives are large (14 TiB for Filecoin's mainnet) and only used in special
//!   situations.
//! - A lite-archive typically has roughly 3 million blocks, 2000 complete sets of
//!   state-roots, and 2000 sets of messages. These archives usually take up
//!   roughly 100 GiB.
//! - A diff-archive contains the subset of nodes that are _not_ shared by two
//!   other archives. These archives are much smaller but can rarely be used on
//!   their own. They are typically merged with other archives before use.
//!
//! The sub-commands in this module manipulate archive files without needing a
//! running Forest-daemon or a separate database. Operations are carried out
//! directly on CAR files.
