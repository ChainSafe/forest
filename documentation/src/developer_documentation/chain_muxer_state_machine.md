`ChainMuxer` state transitions:

    A[Idle]
    B[Connect]
    C[Bootstrap]
    D[Follow]

    A -->|sync| B
    A -->|skip| D
    B -->|behind| C
    B -->|in-sync| D
    D -->|on-error| A
    C --> A
```

Once the `ChainMuxer` is in `follow` mode, it passes control to the
`TipsetProcessor`. A typical start-up sequence looks like this:

1. `idle` state: Immediately switch to `connect` state.
2. `connect` state: Wait for 5 tipsets from peers. If we're within 1 epoch of
   the heaviest seen tipset, switch to `follow` state. Otherwise, switch to
   `bootstrap` state.
3. `bootstrap` state: Fetch tipsets between the heaviest seen tipset and the
   last validated tipset. Validate all of those tipsets and return to `idle`
   state.
4. `follow` state: Pass control to the `TipsetProcessor` state machine.
