# Overview

The RPC interface is the primary mechanism for interacting with Forest. The
implementation is still a WIP, with support for more methods being added
continuously.

As there is presently no cross-client specification, the Lotus
[V0](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/documentation/en/api-v0-methods.md)
and
[V1](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/documentation/en/api-v1-unstable-methods.md)
APIs are the reference for Forest's implementation.

# Supported Methods

We currently track all methods and their implementation state
[here](https://github.com/orgs/ChainSafe/projects/29).
