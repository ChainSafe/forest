# Forest

Forest is an implementation of [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) written in Rust. The implementation takes a modular approach to building a full Filecoin node in two parts — (i) building Filecoin’s security critical systems in Rust from the [Filecoin Protocol Specification](https://filecoin-project.github.io/specs/), specifically the virtual machine, blockchain, and node system, and (ii) integrating functional components for storage mining and storage & retrieval markets to compose a fully functional Filecoin node implementation.
