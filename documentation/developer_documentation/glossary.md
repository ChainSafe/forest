## BLAKE2b
[BLAKE2b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAKE_(hash_function)) is a cryptographic hash function.

## BLS
[BLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLS_digital_signature) stadns for Boneh–Lynn–Shacham cryptographic signature scheme, which is a cryptographic signature scheme which allows a user to verify that a signer is authentic.

## CBOR
Concise Binary Object Representation see [here](https://cbor.io/)

## CID

[CID](https://spec.filecoin.io/#section-libraries.multiformats.cids) is short for Content Identifier, a self describing content address used throughout the IPFS ecosystem. CIDs are used in Filecoin to identify files submitted to the decentralized storage network. For more detailed information, see [the github documentation for it](https://github.com/ipld/cid).

## IPLD
[IPLD](https://github.com/ipld) stands for InterPlanetary Linked Data, which is a series of standards and formats for describing data in a content-addressing-emphatic way.

## JWT
JSON Web Token see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token)

## SECP
types of elliptic curves used for ECDSA see [here](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2018/08/21/a-tale-of-two-elliptic-curves/)

## multisig
multi-signature

## Tipset
contains a non-empty collection of blocks that have distinct miners and all specify identical epoch, parents, weight, height, state root, receipt root

## Tipsetkey
A set of CIDs forming a unique key for a tipset.

## mempool
message pool

## Sortition
In governance, [sortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition) is the selection of political officials as a random sample from a larger pool of candidates.

## IPFS
[IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs) stands for InterPlanetary File System which is A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol to make the web faster, safer, and more open.

## Proof of Spacetime (PoSt)

[_Proof-of-Spacetime_](pos#post) is a procedure by which a [storage-miner](glossary#storage-miner-actor) can prove to the Filecoin network they have stored and continue to store a unique copy of some data on behalf of the network for a period of time. Proof-of-Spacetime manifests in two distinct varieties in the present Filecoin specification: [Window Proof-of-Spacetime](glossary#window-proof-of-spacetime-windowpost) and [Winning Proof-of-Spacetime](glossary#winning-proof-of-spacetime-winningpost).

## HAMT
[HAMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie) stands for Hash array mapped trie, which is an implementation of an associative array that combines the characteristics of a hash table and an array mapped trie.[

## VRF

A Verifiable Random Function (VRF) that receives {Secret Key (SK), seed} and outputs {proof of correctness, output value}. VRFs must yield a proof of correctness and a unique & efficiently verifiable output. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_random_function)

## MDNS
Multicast DNS see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS)

## KV
